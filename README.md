# Milestone project 2  

This website was created to help people find their next travel destination.

## The live website can be found here: https://gazmoore100.github.io/Milestone-project-2/

### Project aim -  

The purpose of this project was to provide a website where users could gain inspiration for new travel destinations
and find useful tips for travelling abroad. I also wanted to include links to other useful websites that would provide relevant 
travel services. As well as destination information I also wanted to provide weather and flight booking information in order
to provide a one stop site for user's travel needs. Future development for this site would include the implementation of a 
members portal where users can save travel deals, select favourite destinations and book holidays.

To maintain a clean appearence and good UX I decided to implement the same navbar and footer across all pages on the site and tried
to avoid cramming too much text on any one page. To help with this a split the site in to different pages rather than having a single
page which scrolled.

My initial designs included the implementation of a weather widget which would allow the user to search for the weather in
any location. This design was changed due to the time needed to implement this feature.
